# Complete_Street_Rule
This is an updated repository for a modified version of the ESRI Complete Street rule by the original rule author. 
The rule uses the original assets folder of the ESRI Complete street rule, so in order to use it, you really only need the updated CGA file. 

The rules new features include: 

1. A Best Fit setting so that the exact geometry is optional. 
2. An updated bicycle stress metric.
3. Miscellanous bug fixes such as preventing the creation of stripped lanes on lanes near the center line.
